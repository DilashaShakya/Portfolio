## About

This portfolio is part of my effort to revisit **HTML and CSS fundamentals** while following **Angela Yu’s Web Development course**.

Although I’ve worked on larger projects before, I wanted to slow down and revisit the basics. Reinforcing core concepts helps improve layout, styling, and attention to small UI details.

## Focus Areas

- Clean HTML structure  
- CSS layouts and animations  
- Simple interactions and visual details  
- Strengthening frontend fundamentals  

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (minimal, for basic interactions)

---

## Why This Project

This project is less about perfection and more about learning, experimenting, and gradually improving foundational skills.

## Status

🚧 **In Progress** — actively refining and updating.
