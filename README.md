About This Project

This portfolio is part of my effort to revisit HTML and CSS fundamentals while following Angela Yu’s Web Development course.

Although I’ve worked on larger projects before, I wanted to slow down and revisit the basics. Revisiting core concepts helps me better understand layout, styling, and small UI details that are easy to overlook when moving too quickly.

This project is mainly focused on:

Practicing clean HTML structure

Relearning CSS layouts and animations

Experimenting with simple interactions and visual details

Strengthening my overall frontend foundation

Tech Used

HTML5

CSS3

A small amount of JavaScript for basic interactions

Why This Project

Going back to the basics has been a helpful reminder that strong fundamentals matter. This portfolio is less about perfection and more about learning, experimenting, and improving step by step.

Status

🚧 In progress — I’ll continue updating and refining this as I learn more.
